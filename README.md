# SheCodes
This repository contains projects I created during SheCodes courses. 

The first project is the final project of Basic Python course: a system to mark attendance for employees and volunteers of a fictional organization called DustBusters.

This project was created and tested on Windows 10 using Python 3.9.0 and Anaconda. It requires pandas.
